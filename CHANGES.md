###Changes in 0.2.3.2 (07-Oct-2013)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Implementation of "JClic System Libraries": System admins can now define libraries of JClic projects as a “System setting” for all users of a specific computer.

###Changes in 0.2.0.5 (16-Jun-2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###Changes in 0.2.0.4 (11-Jun-2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a maintenance release.
- Added translations to new languages: Italian (full) and Russian (not yet finished)
- JClicAuthor can now run as an applet. Tha file dist/jclic/author.html contains an example of this modality.

###Changes in 0.2.0.3 (03-Apr-2008)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Support for QuickTime 6.0 has been suppressed in JClic. Users of Mac OSX can still make use of QuickTime for Java 6.1 or later.
- JClic runs now on Java 1.4 or later. JRE 1.3.1 is no longer supported. This avoids the need of provide specific modules for the basic Java XML API (JAXP, DOM and Xalan), because they are already included in the Java 1.4 specification. JDOM 1.0 still remains as a external module needed by JClic.
- Changes in the source code, in order to make it fully compilable without external non-free dependencies: The binary files QTJava.zip, jclicjmf.jar and servlet.jar are no longer distributed with the source code of JClic, because of licensing issues. In order to make possible the build process, empty and partial stub implementations of QuickTime for Java, Java Media Framework and JSR-154 (Servlet 2.4) APIs have been included in the "lib" directory. All this stub implementations of the libraries are used only at compile time, and are not included in the binary files obtained as a result of the build process of JClic.
- ANT extensions are no longer needed to build JClic. The password for the key store file (needed to digitally sign the JAR files) is now provided through a include call to the file ~/.ant-global.properties.
- JDOM is now compiled without X-Path functions. This features, not used by JClic, require binary JAR files at compile-time.
- The file jmfhandlers.jar, used to avoid unnecessary http connections to the server during the initialization of Java Media Framework in applets, has been suppressed to avoid copyright conflicts.
- The GIF Encoder library by Rana Bhattacharyya, and the BMP importer by J.Osbaldeston, have been removed. Now the graphics presented in JClic Reports are dynamically generated in PNG format by the Java ImageIO library (included in Java 1.4). The import of BMP files is done by means of the Image4j library (http://image4j.sourceforge.net).
- Important changes have been done in the final packaging of JClic. Since this version, only three JAR files will be generated:
 * `jclic.jar` - Contains all the ingredients needed to run JClic Player and JClic Applet
 * `jclicauthor.jar` - To be used in conjunction with jclic.jar. Contains JClic Author.
 * `jclicreports.jar` - Also to be used with jclic.jar. Contains the stand-alone version of the JClic Reports Server.
- In addition to this three files, `jclicreports.war` and `jclicreports.ear` provide the Servlet version of JClic Reports Server.
- The build.xml file has been changed in many ways to reflect all this changes in the source code structure.
- Added two new skins: "Mini", for embedding JClic projects in blogs and other web pages with small space available, and "Empty", without buttons, counters nor message boxes.
- The cell marker is drawn only when there are more than one cell to solve. In multiple-answer mode, the first valid option is always displayed when the activity is finished, even if another valid option was entered (useful for natural spelling exercises).
- Applets can now handle project installer scripts (files with extension ".jclic.inst"). This allows to perform "one-click" installations of remote JClic projects without using Java WebStart. To use this feature, edit your project with JClicAuthor, generate the installer script (Menu "Tools-Create project installer...") and generate the applet ("Tools - Create web page..."). Then edit the "index.htm" file created in the last step, find the line that starts with "writePlugin" and change the project's file name ("yourproject.jclic.zip") by the installer one ("yourproject.jclic.inst").
- New translation system hosted in [Launchpad.net](https://translations.launchpad.net/jclic) and new translations: Basque, Greek, Danish and Turkish.

###Changes in 0.1.2.2 (23-Feb-2007)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Corrected bug #41: "Conditional jumps between sequence elements are not always working as expected". Conditional jumps now are working also in the test window of JClic Author. This will simplify the design and testing of projects that make use of this feature.
- Corrected a bug in the algorithm that computes the global score.
- Corrected some minor mistakes detected in the German translation of JClic.

###Changes in 0.1.2.1 (23-Oct-2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three main changes have been done:
- Feature request #68: In the reports system, the 'content-type' header of the HTTP responses is now "text/xml". This facilitates the integration with PHP-based applications, like Moodle. See http://projectes.lafarga.cat/projects/jclicmoodle for more information about a project that makes use of this feature.
- A new automation module, called "TagReplace", has been created. This module allows to substitute designed tags written in text elements by its associated values, indicated by means of an external text file or URL.
- Feature request #45: JClic Author can now transfer activities between different JClic projects. The "Import activities" feature allows to add to the current project activities taken from another one.

###Changes in 0.1.2.0 (22-May-2006)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is primarily a bug fix release.
The following bugs have been fixed:
- 38: Data lost when editing crosswords. Was caused by a cleanup of excessive cells, incorrectly applied to Crossword activities.
- 51: No way to set dragCells property
- 52: No way to set UseOrder property. Now it's possible to set/unset this boolean properties from JClic author. The check boxes are in the "Options" tab of the Activity editor.
- 42: Changes to the parameters of conditional jumps are not retained. Now the edition of this properties, located in the "Sequences" tab of JClic author, work as expected.
- 83: Custom event sounds ignored in media dependency check. Now custom event sounds are correctly handled by JClic author, both when specified for the whole project or for a specific activity. In addition, changes to the project global skin are also shown in the test activity window.
- 103: User's password not saved in JClic reports. The "edit user" and "create user" forms have been modified, so now the password can be set in JClic Reports when creating a new user, and modified or erased later.
- 46: Windows installer create icons only for the current user. Now the installer defaults to create shortcuts and icons for all users.
